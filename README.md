# Decision Trees and üå≤ Random Forests Tutorial

This repository contains a complete machine learning tutorial that walks through how to build, evaluate, and compare **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**.

## Contents

- `decision_tree_random_forest_tutorial.ipynb`: Full code with humanized markdown explanations  
- `README.md`: This file  
- `LICENSE`: MIT License  
- `tutorial.docx` or `tutorial.pdf`: (To be added if exporting report)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how decision trees split data based on impurity measures  
- Learn how random forests improve model performance using ensemble learning  
- Evaluate both models with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
- Visualize a simplified decision tree  

## Dataset

We use the Breast Cancer dataset included in `scikit-learn`. It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric features.  
Target: Binary classification of **malignant (1)** vs **benign (0)** tumors.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- matplotlib & seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
